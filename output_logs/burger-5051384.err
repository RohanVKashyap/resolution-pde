Some weights of ScOT were not initialized from the model checkpoint at camlab-ethz/Poseidon-B and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- embeddings.patch_embeddings.projection.weight: found shape torch.Size([96, 4, 4, 4]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([96, 3, 4, 4]) in the model instantiated
- patch_recovery.mixup.weight: found shape torch.Size([4, 4, 5, 5]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3, 3, 5, 5]) in the model instantiated
- patch_recovery.projection.bias: found shape torch.Size([4]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([3]) in the model instantiated
- patch_recovery.projection.weight: found shape torch.Size([96, 4, 4, 4]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([96, 3, 4, 4]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
